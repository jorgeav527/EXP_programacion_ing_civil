## Civil Code LectureThe
- This is a course where we are going deep to atomization of different day to day tasks in the civil engineer field with the help of several programming Languages like python and JavaScript in a web development environment always in the perfective of a civil engineer.
- First we are going to see the efferents OS and why we have to give a try to Linux.
- Second we are going to see what is web development and the technologies that are behind like the browsers and apps that we use so many times a day then explain what is HTML and CSS which are going to help us giving some structure and style to the programs we create.
- Third define the tools that we are going to get familiar with like the terminal, a popular version control system tool like git and github, that keep track if changes we made to our code and to allow multiple people to collaborate at one project, the editor text where we are going to write and edit code.
- Them we are going to see how programming languages are useful and how we can use as a civil engineer tool. Sometime ago I had this curiosity about what is behind a software or what is behind a API (Application programming Interface) *here the story of how I pass programming with a 17*. How it would help me to get my degree which I totally thankful to Ing Hidalgo and Ing Ruben. I choose this path of ideas and problem solving is using techniques that in fact where familiar to us. The layer of ABSTRACTION is just taking something that's really complex understand it really well and packaging it up and show it in a simpler way that from anybody perfective it can be easily be understand and execute e.g. the car the majority of us doesn't know how the car works or underneath the hood what's inside the engine if something broke but we can use this machine from the inputs or commands we give to it such us pushing the pedal or turning the wheel because that's what I understand to have the output expected which is go forward stop or changing the direction. That's how we abstract the car to only needing to understand and care about its interface. Inside it can change but at the end of the day want I want is to move from one position to another.
- We are going to know of one of the most manageable programming language to program some functions in a functional practical way using Jupyter Notebook. Also we are going to see how we  is the BackEnd and the FrontEnd 
### Operating System Linux (10 min)
- Why so many people is using Linux over Windows or IOS ?
- Freedoom, no licence keys to buy, and no specific hardware just downloaded and its yours.
- The authorization for install and uninstall any software while in Windows you have to choose the correct link to download and try to install by a Graphical User Interface in Linux you just have to write a command and its done.
- Update Window joke for Windows
- Linux can run in practically anything from a super computer to a raspberry Pi and old computers or in a USB with just less than 10 mins to install.
- The majority of the drivers are open source with exceptions for the Nvidia drivers so for that it exist Vulcan.
- The openness of the OS allows you to see and monitored any information that is moving to and from your system and if you are not savvy enough there is always who knows (google or stackoverflow), so you gain privacy and transparency.
- You can customized your OS with your favorite distro and add alternative free software or just install a Window Manager.
- You can navigate the entire system with the command line (The hard part of linux).
- And lastly Linux is a IOS to learn on from the docs and the community from them I really know that there is no stupid question.
- As a civil engineer we care about about Excel, CAD, GIS and Project which has a licence that not anyone could afford. Fortunately in Linux we have some good alternatives like Libraoffice, QGIS and Virtual machines which handle very well any Window programs. In the other hand engineers must know to automatize any task with simple tools and learn how to learn new technologies to be always  
### Terminal (15 min)
- Ctrl + Alt + t
- The terminal is commands interpreter and it is use to access the entire system to install, uninstall and update software, browse and download from the internet and also open, execute, delete files and archives. 
- The terminal is the program that allows us to have access to the shell.
- The shell is the interpreter that allows us to communicated to the OS.
- This shell that I'm use for is for a plain text and its called bash.
- Bash is a command language as a free software for IOS and Linux.
- Its like a waiters we ask and will answer and deliver.
- The terminal has a few parts the name of the login user @ and the name of the device : #(root), ~(home), /(root) depends of were we are in the system and at last $ which means that is ready to go.
#### Useful Commands
- "echo" 
- pwd **print working directory** 
- whoami 
- hostname 
- ls **list directories**
- ll **list all**
- cd / **change to the root folder**
- cd ~ **change to the home folder**
- cd .
- cd ..
- cp **copy files**
- mv **move files**
- rm -f **remove a file or a directory**
- touch **create a file**
- mkdir **create a directory**
- clear 
### Text Editors
*Could be boring for someones, or a most important tool for your work*
- the learn curve is different for each
- all of them are very customized
- the have plugins (extensions), autocomplete, integration with git, themes
- are compatible for Linux MAC and Windows
*emacs and vim make your homework, answer the phone when you are playing, do the dishes and take out the dog*
